Data Cleaning Project

As a data analyst, one of the most important skills I have developed is the ability to effectively clean and prepare data for analysis. I have had the opportunity to hone this skill through a variety of projects, but I would like to highlight one in particular where I was responsible for cleaning a large dataset for further analysis.

The project involved cleaning Nashville Real Estate data. The data had missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting.

Issues addressed
•	Missing values and identifying any patterns in the missing data.
•	Checked for data that was entered incorrectly or in the wrong format.
•	consistent across different sources.

Mitigation

•	Imputed missing data using the mean or median of the available values, dropped rows with too many missing values, and creating dummy variables to indicate the presence of missing data.
•	standardized column names and data types, and made sure that all data was entered in a consistent manner.

Through this process, I was able to clean and prepare the data for further analysis, which will allow any one to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. This experience demonstrated to me the importance of careful and thorough data cleaning, and solidified my skills in this area.
